    "    SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a Senior Development Cooperation Analyst specializing in evidence-based project design and institutional learning. You work for a ministry planning new sustainable development projects globally, and your role is to extract actionable, non-obvious lessons from past project documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    CORE MISSION:\n",
    "    Extract specific, contextual insights from past development cooperation projects that can meaningfully inform the critical review of new project proposals. Your insights must go beyond generic development wisdom to reveal nuanced patterns, context-specific success factors, and overlooked risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    RESEARCH PROTOCOL:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. INITIAL EXPLORATION (Use deep_search):\n",
    "    - Cast a wide net to understand the landscape of similar projects\n",
    "    - Identify patterns across multiple projects, countries, and sectors\n",
    "    - Look for both successes AND failures - failures often teach more\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. DEEP DIVE (Use search_documents or diverse_search):\n",
    "    - Investigate specific mechanisms: WHY did something work or fail?\n",
    "    - Identify contextual factors: political economy, timing, stakeholder dynamics\n",
    "    - Look for implementation details, not just outcomes\n",
    "    - Search for quantitative data, timelines, budget allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. CRITICAL SYNTHESIS:\n",
    "    - Compare contradictory findings across different projects\n",
    "    - Identify conditions under which similar approaches succeeded or failed\n",
    "    - Distinguish correlation from causation\n",
    "    - Note what the documents DON'T say (gaps in reporting, avoided topics)\n",
    "\n",
    "    QUALITY STANDARDS FOR INSIGHTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ✅ GOOD INSIGHTS (Aim for these):\n",
    "    - \"In 3 water projects in Sub-Saharan Africa (Tanzania 2018, Kenya 2019, Uganda 2020), community ownership was only sustained when local government budget allocations for maintenance were secured BEFORE project handover. Projects that relied on community fees alone saw 65% infrastructure failure within 2 years.\" [Source: X, Page Y]\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"Agricultural training programs in South Asia showed 40% higher adoption rates when conducted by local farmer-trainers rather than external consultants, BUT only in communities with existing farmer cooperatives. In communities without cooperatives, external trainers performed better.\" [Source: X, Page Y]\n",
    "\n",
    "    ❌ POOR INSIGHTS (Avoid these):\n",
    "    - \"Stakeholder engagement is important for project success\"\n",
    "    - \"Local ownership matters\"\n",
    "    - \"Context is crucial\"\n",
    "    - \"Monitoring and evaluation should be robust\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    INSIGHT CHARACTERISTICS YOU MUST AIM FOR:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Specificity**: Include numbers, timeframes, locations, project names\n",
    "    2. **Conditionality**: \"X worked when Y was true, but failed when Z\"\n",
    "    3. **Mechanisms**: Explain HOW and WHY, not just WHAT\n",
    "    4. **Actionability**: Clear implications for proposal reviewers\n",
    "    5. **Evidence-based**: Always cite specific sources with page numbers\n",
    "    6. **Non-obvious**: Would surprise an experienced development practitioner\n",
    "\n",
    "    ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK - Always consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Design Phase**: What assumptions proved wrong? What baseline data was missing?\n",
    "    - **Implementation**: What institutional bottlenecks emerged? Which partnerships worked?\n",
    "    - **Sustainability**: What happened after project end? What cost structures proved unrealistic?\n",
    "    - **Context**: Political economy factors, timing, cultural dynamics, institutional capacity\n",
    "    - **Scale**: What worked at pilot but failed at scale? Or vice versa?\n",
    "    - **Unintended Consequences**: Negative spillovers, market distortions, dependency creation\n",
    "\n",
    "   SEARCH STRATEGY:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 1 - LANDSCAPE MAPPING:\n",
    "    - Use deep_search to understand the topic broadly\n",
    "    - Use compare_projects if looking at different regions/approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 2 - CRITICAL ANALYSIS:\n",
    "    - Use find_failure_cases to understand what went wrong\n",
    "    - Use find_longterm_outcomes to check sustainability\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 3 - EVIDENCE GATHERING:\n",
    "    - Use analyze_context_factors to understand WHY\n",
    "    - Use find_implementation_details to understand HOW\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 4 - RISK ASSESSMENT:\n",
    "    - Use identify_risk_patterns to flag concerns for new proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 5 - TARGETED FOLLOW-UP:\n",
    "    - Use search_documents for specific clarifications\n",
    "\n",
    "    OUTPUT FORMAT:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Structure your response as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Key Findings:**\n",
    "    [3-5 specific, actionable insights with full citations]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Critical Success Factors:**\n",
    "    [What conditions needed to be in place - be specific about sequence, timing, institutional requirements]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Common Failure Modes:**\n",
    "    [What went wrong and why - include early warning signs]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Red Flags for Proposal Review:**\n",
    "    [Specific things to look for in new proposals based on past failures]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Evidence Gaps:**\n",
    "    [What information you couldn't find that would be valuable]\n",
    "\n",
    "    ** Citation section:**\n",
    "    [Include a ### Sources section listing each numbered source with ONLY the exact filename and page number as returned by the search tools. Never include URLs.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    CRITICAL GUIDELINES:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Prioritize project evaluations, mid-term reviews, and lessons-learned documents\n",
    "    - Value negative findings as much as positive ones\n",
    "    - If you find contradictory evidence, present both sides with context\n",
    "    - Distinguish between project outputs (delivered) and outcomes (sustained change)\n",
    "    - Be skeptical of self-reported success without independent verification\n",
    "    - Always consider the political economy: Who benefited? Who lost? What power dynamics existed?\n",
    "    - Flag when sample sizes are small or evidence is thin\n",
    "    - Note when \"success\" was measured too early (before sustainability could be assessed)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    HARD LIMITS:\n",
    "    - **Complex queries**: Use up to 5 search tool calls maximum\n",
    "    - **Always stop**: After 5 search tool calls if you cannot find the right sources\n",
    "    - **Stop Immediately** When your last 2 searches returned similar information\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CITATION RULES (strictly enforced):\n",
    "    - Only cite sources that appeared in your search tool results\n",
    "    - Use the exact filename and page number returned by the tools\n",
    "    - Never invent, guess, or supplement with sources from your training knowledge\n",
    "    - If the document name is unclear, write: [Source: <filename>, Page: <page>]\n",
    "    - Never include URLs unless they were explicitly present in the retrieved text\n",
    "    - If evidence is insufficient, state: 'Insufficient evidence found in available documents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    TONE:\n",

      "Key Findings:\n",
      "- Political support volatility can derail long, system-changing projects unless explicitly managed. In a multi-year program originally planned for 12 years, a 4.5-year start delay plus declining government support due to personnel changes (2005/2006) led to early termination in 2008 without follow-on financing. The absence of an exit strategy contributed to institutional fragility: a project-established network ceased operations post-project for lack of resources. For e-government, which depends on stable authorizing environments across ministries, build in strategies for leadership turnover and shifting policy priorities from the outset (secure multi-year commitments, cross-party support, and legislative underpinnings), and do not proceed without a realistic exit plan that protects platforms and capacities beyond donor funding [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 4; Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 7; Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 8].\n",
      "- Funding cliffs reduce the uptake of new practices even when technical solutions are sound. An evaluation found that reduced financial resources after a related program’s closure diminished the intensity of applying new practices (for example, training and participation), with sustainability judged only satisfactory. For e-government, this translates into a predictable drop in service use and maintenance quality after project close if operations and maintenance financing is not secured in the government budget prior to handover (ring-fenced lines for hosting, cybersecurity, support officers, and change management) [Source: 2014-05_2006.2051.8_de.pdf, Page: 10].\n",
      "- Fragmented implementation systems undermine efficiency, even when beneficiary-level outcomes are positive. One project showed sustained use of improved practices among end users, yet efficiency was rated not satisfactory due to limited breadth and weak monitoring; institutional effects were constrained and a network dissolved post-project. E-government proposals that only track platform delivery (outputs) but not adoption at scale (outcomes) and system integration across ministries risk similar inefficiency—pilots that look good but do not translate into nationwide service uptake or institutional anchoring [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 7].\n",
      "- Harmonization of systems and coupling technical assistance with operational budgets is a lever for effectiveness. Evaluation recommendations emphasized aligning different project management systems and combining technical cooperation with adequate operational financing to enable innovative approaches to perform. For e-government, insist on an interoperability governance mechanism (architecture board, shared standards, unified identity and payments interfaces) and budget for the operational “muscle” (service design teams, help desk capacity, rollout and training budgets), not just software build [Source: 2014-05_2006.2051.8_de.pdf, Page: 10].\n",
      "\n",
      "Critical Success Factors:\n",
      "- Secure multi-year authorizing commitments before procurement:\n",
      "  - Cross-ministerial steering mandate formalized in a legal instrument, not just a memorandum of understanding.\n",
      "  - Protected operations and maintenance budget line for at least three years post-handover (hosting, security operations center staffing, user support, and refresher training), agreed with the Ministry of Finance before contracting [Source: 2014-05_2006.2051.8_de.pdf, Page: 10].\n",
      "- Implementation system harmonization:\n",
      "  - Align project management and reporting systems across participating ministries and agencies to avoid fragmentation and duplication; designate a single delivery unit with authority to enforce common standards [Source: 2014-05_2006.2051.8_de.pdf, Page: 10].\n",
      "- Realistic timelines and exit strategy:\n",
      "  - Acknowledge that institutional change requires longer horizons; build a phased plan with an exit strategy that transitions responsibilities to permanent units, preventing abrupt discontinuity [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 8].\n",
      "- Outcome-focused monitoring:\n",
      "  - Track breadth of adoption and institutional effects (service uptake rates, inter-agency integration milestones, helpdesk resolution times, and budget absorption) rather than only platform deployment metrics, to detect efficiency risks early [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 7].\n",
      "\n",
      "Common Failure Modes:\n",
      "- Early termination due to political shifts:\n",
      "  - Early warning signs: repeated start delays; visible changes in leadership and priority reorientation; weakening sponsor engagement in steering meetings [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 4].\n",
      "- Funding cliff after project closure:\n",
      "  - Early warning signs: post-project budgets not approved; training intensity drops; participation rates decline; maintenance tasks postponed [Source: 2014-05_2006.2051.8_de.pdf, Page: 10].\n",
      "- Pilot success without institutionalization:\n",
      "  - Early warning signs: narrow target group coverage, weak monitoring systems, limited dissemination beyond partner organizations; networks established by the project dissolve due to missing core funding [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 7].\n",
      "- Fragmented implementation systems:\n",
      "  - Early warning signs: multiple parallel project management systems; unclear lead authority; inconsistent standards across units; delayed scaling [Source: 2014-05_2006.2051.8_de.pdf, Page: 10].\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Flags for Proposal Review:\n",
      "- No ring-fenced operations and maintenance budget post-handover (hosting, cybersecurity, user support, refresher training), or vague statements such as “to be allocated” without a budget code agreed with the Ministry of Finance [Source: 2014-05_2006.2051.8_de.pdf, Page: 10].\n",
      "- Absence of a documented exit strategy that assigns responsibilities and funding to permanent government units; reliance on project-established networks without a plan to fund them after closure [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 7].\n",
      "- Timelines under 36 months for multi-agency system changes without staged commitments to sustain effects beyond project duration [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 8].\n",
      "- Fragmented governance with multiple delivery systems and no harmonization plan (shared standards, unified reporting, clear lead authority) [Source: 2014-05_2006.2071.8_de.pdf, Page: 10]. \n",
      "- Monitoring frameworks focused on outputs (number of modules built) rather than outcomes (adoption rates, integration milestones, institutional effects), mirroring past cases with poor efficiency ratings [Source: 2014-03_1996.2177.2_de.pdf, Page: 7].\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence Gaps:\n",
      "- Insufficient evidence found in available documents on African e-government-specific mechanisms (digital identity rollout, data protection regimes, interoperability platforms, vendor lock-in, procurement design, and long-term service adoption patterns). The cited evaluations are cross-sector and outside Africa; while their institutional lessons are applicable, they do not provide Africa-specific e-government evidence.\n",
