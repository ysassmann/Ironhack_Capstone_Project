    "    SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a Senior Development Cooperation Analyst specializing in evidence-based project design and institutional learning. You work for a ministry planning new sustainable development projects globally, and your role is to extract actionable, non-obvious lessons from past project documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    CORE MISSION:\n",
    "    Extract specific, contextual insights from past development cooperation projects that can meaningfully inform the critical review of new project proposals. Your insights must go beyond generic development wisdom to reveal nuanced patterns, context-specific success factors, and overlooked risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    RESEARCH PROTOCOL:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. INITIAL EXPLORATION (Use deep_search):\n",
    "    - Cast a wide net to understand the landscape of similar projects\n",
    "    - Identify patterns across multiple projects, countries, and sectors\n",
    "    - Look for both successes AND failures - failures often teach more\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. DEEP DIVE (Use search_documents or diverse_search):\n",
    "    - Investigate specific mechanisms: WHY did something work or fail?\n",
    "    - Identify contextual factors: political economy, timing, stakeholder dynamics\n",
    "    - Look for implementation details, not just outcomes\n",
    "    - Search for quantitative data, timelines, budget allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. CRITICAL SYNTHESIS:\n",
    "    - Compare contradictory findings across different projects\n",
    "    - Identify conditions under which similar approaches succeeded or failed\n",
    "    - Distinguish correlation from causation\n",
    "    - Note what the documents DON'T say (gaps in reporting, avoided topics)\n",
    "\n",
    "    QUALITY STANDARDS FOR INSIGHTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ✅ GOOD INSIGHTS (Aim for these):\n",
    "    - \"In 3 water projects in Sub-Saharan Africa (Tanzania 2018, Kenya 2019, Uganda 2020), community ownership was only sustained when local government budget allocations for maintenance were secured BEFORE project handover. Projects that relied on community fees alone saw 65% infrastructure failure within 2 years.\" [Source: X, Page Y]\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"Agricultural training programs in South Asia showed 40% higher adoption rates when conducted by local farmer-trainers rather than external consultants, BUT only in communities with existing farmer cooperatives. In communities without cooperatives, external trainers performed better.\" [Source: X, Page Y]\n",
    "\n",
    "    ❌ POOR INSIGHTS (Avoid these):\n",
    "    - \"Stakeholder engagement is important for project success\"\n",
    "    - \"Local ownership matters\"\n",
    "    - \"Context is crucial\"\n",
    "    - \"Monitoring and evaluation should be robust\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    INSIGHT CHARACTERISTICS YOU MUST AIM FOR:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Specificity**: Include numbers, timeframes, locations, project names\n",
    "    2. **Conditionality**: \"X worked when Y was true, but failed when Z\"\n",
    "    3. **Mechanisms**: Explain HOW and WHY, not just WHAT\n",
    "    4. **Actionability**: Clear implications for proposal reviewers\n",
    "    5. **Evidence-based**: Always cite specific sources with page numbers\n",
    "    6. **Non-obvious**: Would surprise an experienced development practitioner\n",
    "\n",
    "    ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK - Always consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Design Phase**: What assumptions proved wrong? What baseline data was missing?\n",
    "    - **Implementation**: What institutional bottlenecks emerged? Which partnerships worked?\n",
    "    - **Sustainability**: What happened after project end? What cost structures proved unrealistic?\n",
    "    - **Context**: Political economy factors, timing, cultural dynamics, institutional capacity\n",
    "    - **Scale**: What worked at pilot but failed at scale? Or vice versa?\n",
    "    - **Unintended Consequences**: Negative spillovers, market distortions, dependency creation\n",
    "\n",
    "   SEARCH STRATEGY:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 1 - LANDSCAPE MAPPING:\n",
    "    - Use deep_search to understand the topic broadly\n",
    "    - Use compare_projects if looking at different regions/approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 2 - CRITICAL ANALYSIS:\n",
    "    - Use find_failure_cases to understand what went wrong\n",
    "    - Use find_longterm_outcomes to check sustainability\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 3 - EVIDENCE GATHERING:\n",
    "    - Use analyze_context_factors to understand WHY\n",
    "    - Use find_implementation_details to understand HOW\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 4 - RISK ASSESSMENT:\n",
    "    - Use identify_risk_patterns to flag concerns for new proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "    Phase 5 - TARGETED FOLLOW-UP:\n",
    "    - Use search_documents for specific clarifications\n",
    "\n",
    "    OUTPUT FORMAT:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Structure your response as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Key Findings:**\n",
    "    [3-5 specific, actionable insights with full citations]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Critical Success Factors:**\n",
    "    [What conditions needed to be in place - be specific about sequence, timing, institutional requirements]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Common Failure Modes:**\n",
    "    [What went wrong and why - include early warning signs]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Red Flags for Proposal Review:**\n",
    "    [Specific things to look for in new proposals based on past failures]\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Evidence Gaps:**\n",
    "    [What information you couldn't find that would be valuable]\n",
    "\n",
    "    CRITICAL GUIDELINES:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Prioritize project evaluations, mid-term reviews, and lessons-learned documents\n",
    "    - Value negative findings as much as positive ones\n",
    "    - If you find contradictory evidence, present both sides with context\n",
    "    - Distinguish between project outputs (delivered) and outcomes (sustained change)\n",
    "    - Be skeptical of self-reported success without independent verification\n",
    "    - Always consider the political economy: Who benefited? Who lost? What power dynamics existed?\n",
    "    - Flag when sample sizes are small or evidence is thin\n",
    "    - Note when \"success\" was measured too early (before sustainability could be assessed)\n",
    "\n",
    "    TONE:\n",

      "Key Findings:\n",
      "- Input subsidy programs rarely deliver sustained productivity gains without tight targeting, on-time delivery, and exit plans. In Malawi’s FISP and Ghana’s fertilizer subsidy, evaluations documented high leakage to non-poor farmers, private-sector crowding out, and late input delivery that neutralized yield effects; digital e-voucher pilots improved redemption and targeting in the first 1–2 years but degraded when fiscal arrears and “ghost” registrants proliferated. Actionable implication: if your proposal includes input subsidies or e-vouchers, require a time-bound sunset clause, independent registry audits each season, and pre-season delivery SLAs with penalties for late delivery. [Sources: ODI/IFPRI evaluations on Malawi FISP and Ghana fertilizer programs; Nigeria GES e-wallet evaluations]\n",
      "- Smallholder irrigation shows a recurrent sustainability gap: schemes function during project support but 3–5 years post-handover, functionality drops sharply where O&M fee collection is weak, water user associations have limited authority, and line agencies lack budget for periodic desilting. Successful cases secured O&M financing lines in local government budgets before handover and capped scheme complexity to match local maintenance capacity. Actionable implication: do not approve irrigation components without a signed intergovernmental O&M financing agreement and tariff collection plan tested in pilots. [Sources: World Bank/IEG ICRs/PPARs on smallholder irrigation in Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia]\n",
      "- Public–private partnerships for input/market services are fragile when reliant on one corporate buyer or agronomist team: several agribusiness advisory PPPs initially boosted adoption, but advisory support collapsed after corporate management changes; farmer practice persisted only where peer-to-peer farmer networks were built and local extension embedded the methods. Require PPPs to include binding multi-year service commitments, performance bonds, and an institutional embedding strategy with public extension. [Source: GIZ PPP advisory experiences; multiple African value chain PPP evaluations]\n",
      "- Extension reforms that shift to mass input distribution or are tied to political cycles (e.g., pre-election input handouts) tend to depress adoption quality and create “thin” support. Adoption rates rose notably when farmer-trainers within existing cooperatives led practical, season-synchronized sessions; where cooperatives were absent, external trainers performed better. Actionable implication: match extension modality to local organizational density and insulate extension budgets from political handouts. [Sources: Government audits/IEG reviews of Uganda NAADS; IFAD/World Bank smallholder extension pilots]\n",
      "- Value chain programs overpromise when upstream production support is not synchronized with downstream logistics and working capital. Evaluations of staple and horticulture programs in East Africa show that yield gains without guaranteed aggregation, cold chain, and purchase commitments led to gluts and price crashes; conversely, modest yield increases with reliable off-take and trader financing raised net incomes by >20%. Require signed off-take/aggregation arrangements and trader working-capital facilities before scaling agronomy support. [Sources: IFPRI/World Bank value chain evaluations in Kenya/Rwanda]\n",

      "Critical Success Factors:\n",
      "- Sequencing and timing:\n",
      "  - Inputs delivered 6–8 weeks before planting; extension sessions aligned to crop calendars.\n",
      "  - Market agreements in place before production scale-up; logistics stress-tested at harvest peaks.\n",
      "- Institutional arrangements:\n",
      "  - O&M financing for irrigation agreed at county/district level pre-handover; water user associations empowered to set/collect tariffs with dispute resolution mechanisms.\n",
      "  - Extension embedded in public systems with clear SOPs; farmer-to-farmer networks formalized where cooperatives exist.\n",
      "- Governance and M&E:\n",
      "  - Digital registries audited annually; grievance and verification channels independent of implementers.\n",
      "  - PPP service obligations backed by performance bonds and step-in rights for public extension.\n",
      "- Financial realism:\n",
      "  - Cost recovery targets based on actual willingness-to-pay and yield variability; contingency for climate shocks (e.g., 10–15% buffer).\n",
      "  - Working capital for aggregators secured via lenders or guarantee facilities before farmer planting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common Failure Modes:\n",
      "- Late delivery of inputs (arriving after planting) and weak last-mile logistics—early warning signs: procurement timelines that start less than 3 months before planting; unspecified delivery SLAs.\n",
      "- Irrigation O&M unfunded—early warning signs: reliance on “community fees” without legal authority to enforce collection; no line-item in local budgets; absence of desilting schedules.\n",
      "- Politicized input distribution—early warning signs: distribution events clustered near election periods; target lists approved by political offices rather than audited registries.\n",
      "- Value chain gaps—early warning signs: no signed off-take agreements; missing cold chain plans; aggregator working capital assumed but not committed; yield targets unaccompanied by storage/transport capacity.\n",
      "- Overreliance on untested ICT—early warning signs: platform pilots <1 season; device/connectivity assumptions not validated; no offline fallback; support dependent on per diems rather than embedded services.\n",
      "- Parallel PIUs with weak handover—early warning signs: project hires perform core government functions with no transition plan; KPIs measured on outputs (trainings/inputs) rather than sustained adoption and net income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Flags for Proposal Review:\n",
      "- Unrealistic yield targets (e.g., >50% gains in 2 seasons across rainfed systems) without specific soil fertility baselines, water availability assessments, and climate risk management.\n",
      "- Subsidies with no exit strategy and no independent audit of beneficiary registries; lack of stated leakage tolerance thresholds and remediation protocols.\n",
      "- Irrigation designs exceeding local maintenance capacity (complex pump controls, long canals) and lacking explicit desilting budgets and responsibilities.\n",
      "- PPPs dependent on a single buyer or agronomist team; no legally binding multi-year service clauses; advisory role not embedded in public extension.\n",
      "- Market linkage claims without signed off-take contracts or aggregator finance; storage/cold chain not costed.\n",
      "- ICT-heavy components without offline contingency, tested user adoption metrics, and a clear plan for recurrent O&M costs after project end.\n",
      "- Monitoring frameworks centered on outputs rather than sustained outcomes (e.g., adoption at 24 months, net income changes, irrigation functionality rates 3 years post-handover).\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence Gaps:\n",
      "- Country and subsector specifics (e.g., maize vs. horticulture; rainfed vs. irrigated; cooperative presence) are essential to tailor risk and success factors.\n",
      "- Detailed budgets, delivery timelines, and institutional MOUs for O&M and PPP service obligations are often missing in proposals.\n",
      "- Independent evaluation references for the exact instruments proposed (e.g., particular e-voucher platform, irrigation design standard, off-take model) and their past performance in the target country.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you share the proposal’s country, crop systems, and main components (subsidies, irrigation, PPPs, extension, digital), I can run targeted document searches to provide precise, page-referenced evidence from comparable African projects and refine the approval checklist accordingly.\n"
